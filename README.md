# All About Decision Trees

Welcome to the All About Decision Trees project! This repository contains implementations of the ID3 and CART algorithms for constructing decision trees, as well as different impurity measures such as the Gini index and entropy index. Additionally, pre-pruning and post-pruning techniques are also included.



# Contents



- ID3 Algorithm: Implementation of the ID3 algorithm for decision tree induction.

- CART Algorithm: Implementation of the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm.

- Gini Index: Calculation of the Gini index as a measure of impurity in decision trees.

- Entropy Index: Calculation of the entropy index as a measure of impurity in decision trees.

- Pre-Pruning: Techniques for early stopping or pruning decision trees to prevent overfitting.

- Post-Pruning: Techniques for pruning decision trees after they have been fully grown.

- Examples: Example datasets and code snippets to demonstrate the usage of decision tree algorithms.
